            <h1>About Dead Weight Fit</h1>
            <p>Dead Weight Fit is an apparel company with a heart. Each month, we partner with a different charity to create a unique T-shirt design. We donate 50% of the sales from these designs directly to the featured charity, helping to support their important work.</p>
            <p>Founded by Jaread Parziale, our mission is to blend fashion with philanthropy, creating a brand that not only looks good but also does good. Join us in making a difference, one shirt at a time.</p>
            <p>Our designs are crafted with care, and we are dedicated to using high-quality materials that are both comfortable and durable. At Dead Weight Fit, we believe in the power of community and the impact that we can make together. Thank you for supporting our cause and helping us make a difference in the world.</p>
